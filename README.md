# FitLit

## Overview

FitLit is an application I developed during my second module at the Turing School of Software and Design. It is a fitness tracker app that provides a simple user interface for displaying data related to activity, sleep, and hydration. While this was intended to be a partner project, but in a class with an odd number of students, I got lucky or unlucky, depending on your perspective, and ended up working on this project solo.

Good luck and have fun!
